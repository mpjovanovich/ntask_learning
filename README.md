# ntask_learning
n-task learning algorithm demos

This program encapsulates the core methodology that was used for the below research:

Jovanovich, M., & Phillips, J. (2018, July). n-task Learning: Solving Multiple or Unknown Numbers of Reinforcement Learning Problems. In CogSci (pp. 584-589).

The entry point is wcst_ntask_demo.r, which can be run using the arguments specified in the code file header.

The hrr.r file is a supporting library - holographic reduced representations were used to provide easy encoding into the neural networks that servered as 
reward and task switching functions for the model.
